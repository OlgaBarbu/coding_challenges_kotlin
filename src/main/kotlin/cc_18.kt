/*
    Coding Challenge #18
    Have the function simple_symbols(input) take the input parameter being passed.

    Determine if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string true or false.
    The input parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several characters between them (ie. ++d+===+c++==a)
    For the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol.
    So the string to the left would be false, because a is not surrounded by + symbols.
    The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter.
